## About our dependencies

VoidFinder Toolkit is built on top of many codes provided by the cosmological community.

We thank and recognize the efforts and contributions of all of them.

## ZOBOV

ZOBOV (ZOnes Bordering On Voidness) is an algorithm that finds density depressions in a set of points, without any free parameters, or assumptions about shape. It uses the Voronoi tessellation to estimate densities, which it uses to find both voids and subvoids. It also measures probabilities that each void or subvoid arises from Poisson fluctuations.
