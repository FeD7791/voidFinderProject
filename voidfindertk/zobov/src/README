= About =

This package includes VOBOZ (VOronoi BOund Zones), version 1.2, a
halo-finding algorithm by Mark Neyrinck.  It also includes the
void-finding algorithm ZOBOV.  Many thanks to Rick Wagner
(http://lca.ucsd.edu/projects/rpwagner/; rick@ucsd.edu) for doing
modifications 1-6, bringing VOBOZ to v. 1.2.  This README file is also
largely copied from him.  Documentation on VOBOZ is at

  http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~neyrinck/voboz.  

Rick also put up a nice wiki containing some information about the
examples he created, and how to run VOBOZ:

This version contains both the VOBOZ source code, and the Qhull code.

For help in understanding VOBOZ, also see the paper describing it, at
http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0402346 (Neyrinck, Gnedin & Hamilton).
If these resources are insufficient, feel free to email
Mark.Neyrinck@colorado.edu with questions.

= Modifications =

In version 1.2, VOBOZ has been modified as follows:
 1) Accept the precision settings of Qhull.
 2) Corrected particle indexing in boz.c.
 3) Moved qhull_a.h into voz.h.
 4) Moved common defines into voz.h.
 5) Fixed first array error in readfiles.c:posread
 6) Makefile changes, including clean and install targets.

 7) voztie.c no longer dies if the volumes measured for a particle differ.
 8) ZOBOV and VOBOZ are now in a single package.

Qhull has not been modified, and is included only for convenience.

= Contents =

qhull    - Qhull source code
voboz    - VOBOZ source code
bin      - empty, VOBOZ binaries get installed there
examples - code to generate sample datasets and scripts

= Building = 

To build VOBOZ, modify the Makefiles in src/, qhull/src/ and examples/ for 
your local machine. Currently, the files are set up to use GCC on generic
Unix/Linux type operating systems (including OS X).

To build, run `make` from this directory. This will compile qhull and the
VOBOZ programs, and place the VOBOZ programs in bin/. `make clean` removes
all binary files, etc.

= Examples =

Running `make examples` will build the sample data in examples/, and run 
VOBOZ on it. Currently, these examples are mostly for reference on how to run
the programs, and how data is handled.

= Precision =

The default precision is double (8 byte floats); to change this, edit 
qhull/src/user.h, and change REALfloat to 1.

= Mini-License =

This is free software.  It may be freely copied, modified, and
redistributed, as long as the authors are acknowledged.  There is no
warranty or other guarantee of fitness for VOBOZ or ZOBOV; they are
provided "as are."  We welcome bug reports (but do not guarantee their
fixing), which should be sent to Mark.Neyrinck@colorado.edu.
